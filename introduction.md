### Introduction

This reading is highly recommended if you want either to customize your installation or if you want to develop a full-featured plugin. In fact, the first case should lead to the latter, as the architecture allow a great flexibility, and thinking always “extension” will allow you to upgrade much more easily in the future releases. You should be basically comfortable with XML and XPath syntaxes, as well as PHP if you want to add server-side functions, and JavaScript if you want to add client-side behaviours.
